                        In a move that has captured global attention, Singapore has doubled in size over just a few
                        short years—an achievement hailed as remarkable but not without controversy. As the city-state
                        expands its footprint through innovative floating platforms and extensive new developments,
                        questions have arisen regarding the resources fuelling this unprecedented growth. Recently
                        released data reveals the answer, and it is both surprising and contentious.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        With natural resources becoming increasingly scarce in the year 2050 and prices for imports
                        soaring, Singapore faced a difficult choice. Unable to afford the high cost of imported
                        materials, the government turned to large-scale mining and resource harvesting on its own nature
                        reserves and surrounding islands. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        These areas, once dedicated to conservation, housed a rich
                        diversity of plants, animals, and other species that are now under severe threat. Destruction of
                        these habitats has led to habitat loss, pushing species to extinction and undoing years of
                        conservation work. Reports estimate that at least six species have gone extinct as a result,
                        causing large-scale ecosystem destabilization and a significant loss of biodiversity.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Government officials have defended the decision as a necessary response to overpopulation. As
                        the city’s population continued to soar, land for housing and infrastructure grew critically
                        limited, and drastic measures became inevitable. The plan to use local resources was put to a
                        public vote, with the majority supporting it due to overcrowding and increasing discomfort in
                        daily life. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        “It’s crazy eh, whenever I try to drive home from work in CBD (Central Business
                        District) during peak hour, I would be stuck in a traffic jam for more than an hour. I think at this point you might as well not own a car anymore. Just harvest the materials
                        from the nature reserves and expand Singapore already, who cares if some species goes extinct, they are
                        not important anyway” said one resident from Bedok, who chose to remain anonymous.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        However, despite the majority supporting the plan, a vocal minority opposed it, going so far as to
                        organize protests or relocate to another country to distance themselves from the cause.
                        The situation has sparked a global debate on whether this was an appropriate trade-off to secure
                        a higher quality of life in Singapore, or an irreversible loss to natural heritage? As nations
                        observe Singapore’s bold land expansion, they confront a larger ethical question: how much is
                        Singapore willing to sacrifice for growth and comfort?

                        SINGAPORE - Singapore’s beloved hawker culture, a staple of the nation’s identity since the 1800s and listed
                        on UNESCO’s Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, is set to disappear
                        within months as changing career paths and new employment systems reshape the workforce.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                         A recent survey of former hawkers reveals that many are leaving the trade due to old age, long
                        working hours, low income, underappreciation, and the physically demanding nature of the job.
                        And with the help from Singapore’s new education and employment system that harnesses AI
                        technology to guarantee jobs through its dynamic job-matching algorithms, a significant number
                        of hawkers have decided to seek alternative careers and have successfully trained and
                        transitioned into less labour-intensive roles with higher pay.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Meanwhile, for younger generations, hawker careers seem to be increasingly unattractive. Data
                        reveals that less than 2% of students would consider becoming hawkers and would rather opt for
                        higher-paying blue- and white-collar professions. Therefore, in response to the resulting
                        manpower shortage in hawker centres, the government has made the difficult decision to close all
                        hawker centres by the end of 2030. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Moving forward, more food courts, restaurants, and standalone
                        food outlets will be established to fill the void left by hawker centres. However, with this
                        shift, potential price increases are expected as the food industry consolidates.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As such, the decision has sparked an online debate over the impact of the new system and the
                        loss of Singapore’s hawker culture. Some argue that it has improved opportunities and income
                        security, while others blame it for the cause of diminishing Singapore’s cultural heritage and
                        national identity. As Singapore bids farewell to its hawker centres, the question lingers: is
                        this a step forward or are we digging ourselves into a hole? And what other cherished
                        traditions might fade away in the years to come?
